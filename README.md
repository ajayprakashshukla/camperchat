# camperchat 

## About Project 

we will be building Camper Chat, which will essentially be a live chat
application. Users will be able to log in with their Facebook account and chat all things
caravan and camping with anybody else who is using the application. The coolest thing
about this application is the integration with PouchDB for storing local data and Cloudant
for syncing that PouchDB data to a remote backend. This means that the data can be
available to users when they are offline, and when they come back online again the latest
updates will be fetched from the remote backend.

## Code base contains following features: 
Navigation
</br>Using a Sliding Menu
</br>Using PouchDB to store local data
</br>Using Cloudant to store remote data
</br>Using the Facebook API for authentication and other features
</br>Updating and displaying data in real time

Happy coding!
